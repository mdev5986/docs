**The Tech Behind Your Voice Interactions**

We use smart, modern tools to make voice conversations smooth, natural, and helpful. Here’s what’s under the hood:

---
## 1. Call Management System
### [FreeSWITCH](https://freeswitch.org/)

#### Why it matters
- Routes calls flawlessly
- Works with phones, apps, and devices
- Scales from small teams to global systems

## 2. Smart Answer Assistant
### [RAG Knowledge](https://www.ragknowledge.com/)

## 3. Conversation Brain
### [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
The "thinker" that understands tricky questions, slang, or long sentences. It’s like having a quick-witted teammate who always knows how to respond.

#### Why it matters

- Adapts to casual or formal tones
- Improves as it chats with more users

---

---
## 5. Text-to-Speech Voice Builder
### [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)
