## What You'll See on Your Dashboard
### 1. Your Daily Overview

At the top of your screen, you'll find four important numbers that tell you how your AI agent is doing:

**Number of Calls:** How many calls your AI has handled
- **Example:** "500 calls" shows your AI is keeping busy answering customers
- **Find this:** in the second card

**Total Spent:** How much you've invested in your AI calls
