## Activating and Deactivating Users

You can temporarily disable access for team members without permanently removing them from your workspace.

### Deactivating a User

When you deactivate a user:
- Their access to the workspace is immediately revoked
- Their account remains in your workspace with all settings preserved
- They will not count against your active user limit for billing purposes

To deactivate a user:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Team Management**
2. Find the user in the team members list
3. Toggle the **Active** switch to the off position
4. Confirm the deactivation in the dialog that appears

### Reactivating a User

To restore access for a deactivated user:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Team Management**
2. Click the **Show Inactive Users** filter at the top of the team list
3. Find the inactive user
4. Toggle the **Active** switch to the on position

## Removing Team Members

To permanently remove a team member from your workspace:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Team Management**
2. Find the user in the team members list
3. Click the Delete button to remove the user
5. Confirm the removal in the dialog that appears

<Note>
Removing a user is permanent. If you want to temporarily disable access, consider deactivating the user instead.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- **Regular audits**: Periodically review your team members and their access levels
- **Principle of least privilege**: Assign users the minimum level of access required for their role
- **Offboarding**: Promptly remove access for departing team members
- **Custom roles**: Create role-specific permissions for specialized teams
