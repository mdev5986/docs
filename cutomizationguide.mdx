## 3. Build Your Script

**What to do:** Use plain English to tell your AI what to say. No coding required!

- **Start with a greeting:**
<Note>
**Example:** “Hi, thanks for calling [Your Business]! How can I help you today?”
</Note>
- **Add FAQs:**
<Note>
**Example:** “We’re open Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM.”
</Note>
- **End with a call to action:**
<Note>
**Example:** “Would you like to book an appointment or hear more about our services?”
</Note>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** Keep it conversational. Imagine you’re talking to a customer in person.
</Tip>

**Pro Tips for Customization**
- **Sound Natural:** Use contractions (e.g., “I’m” instead of “I am”) and avoid robotic phrasing.
- **Keep It Short:** Customers appreciate concise answers.
- **Add Personality:** Use phrases that reflect your brand’s vibe (e.g., “Howdy!” for a casual tone or “How may I assist you?” for a formal tone).
</Tip>
